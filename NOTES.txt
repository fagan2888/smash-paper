What's included
---------------

This repo contains the following directories:

`res_paper`: .RData objects which contain simulation results for all
the simulation studies conducted. Specifically:

* `res_gaus_dscr.RData` : Gaussian simulations with n = 1024 (run in
  dsc framework; code at https://github.com/zrxing/dscr-smash)

* `res_gaus_256.RData`, `res_gaus_512.RData` : Gaussian simulations
  with n = 256 and n = 512 respectively.

* `res_pois.RData` contains the simulation results for Poisson
  observations,

* `res_pois_hf.RData` contains results from experimenting with
  different Gaussian denoising techniques in the second stage of the
  Haar-Fisz Poisson de-noising algorithm.

`code`: contains three sub-directories. 

* `gaus_data` contains the code for several analyses for Gaussian data
  using SMASH, including examples not covered in the main paper.

* `pois_data` contains the code for running SMASH on the ChIP-seq
  experiment from ENCODE.

* `sim` contains several R scripts for generating figures and tables
  used in the paper and the supplementary materials.

  + `pois` contains R and Matlab code for generating the simulation
  results for Poisson observations (`sim_pois.R` and `sim_pois.m`), as
  well as an R script to test out different Haar-Fisz options
  (`sim_hf.R`).
  
  + `plot_gaus.R` and `plot_pois.R` contain all the code for
  generating all the figures in the paper;
  
  + `table_gaus.R` generates Tex tables containing the MISE for each
  simulation scenario, as well as an additional table detailing
  additional information about the various methods used;
  
  + `table_pois` generates the full results for the Poisson simulation
  study which are shown in supplementary materials.
