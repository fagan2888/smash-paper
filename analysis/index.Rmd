This repository contains data and R source code accompanying our
manuscript,

> Zhengrong Xing and Matthew Stephens (2016). *Smoothing via Adaptive
Shrinkage (smash): denoising Poisson and heteroskedastic Gaussian
signals.* [arXiv:1709.10066][smash-preprint].

If you find any of the source code in this repository useful for your
work, please cite our paper.

The new methods can be found in the [smashr package][smashr].

## Contents

The following analyses generate some of the empirical results
presented in [Xing & Stephens (2016)][smash-preprint]. If you
encounter a problem running any of the R code in these examples,
please post an [issue][issues].

### Illustration

+ [SMASH applied to the "Spikes" data set.](spikesdemo.html)

### Simulation experiments

1. [Estimating the mean function from Gaussian-distributed
data.](gaussmeanest.html)

2. [Plots of the mean and variance functions used to simulate Gaussian data for the mean estimation experiments.](gaussian_signals.html)

3. [Interactive plot fore exploring results of Gaussian mean estimation experiments.](gauss_shiny_setup.html)

4. [Estimating the variance function from Gaussian-distributed
data.](gaussvarest.html)

3. Poisson-distributed data.

### Illustrative applications
