This repository contains source code and data accompanying our manuscript,

> Zhengrong Xing and Matthew Stephens (2016). *Smoothing via Adaptive
Shrinkage (smash): denoising Poisson and heteroskedastic Gaussian
signals.* [arXiv:1709.10066](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07787).

The new methods can be found in the [smashr package][smashr].

## Contents

The following analyses generate some of the empirical results
presented in [Xing & Stephens (2016)][smashr-preprint]. If you
encounter a problem running any of the R code in these examples,
please post an [issue][issues].

+ [Illustration of SMASH applied to the "spikes" data set.](spikesdemo.html)

+ [Comparison of signal denoising methods in Gaussian-distributed data
  sets.](gaussian.mean.est.html)

+ [Application of SMASH to motorcycle acceleration data.](motorcycle.html)

+ [Application of SMASH to ChIP-seq data.](chipseq.html)
