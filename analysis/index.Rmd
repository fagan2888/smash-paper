This repository contains source code and data accompanying our manuscript:

> Zhengrong Xing and Matthew Stephens (2016). *Smoothing via Adaptive
Shrinkage (smash): denoising Poisson and heteroskedastic Gaussian
signals.* [arXiv:1709.10066](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07787).

reproduce some of the
empirical results presented in [Xing & Stephens (2016)][smashr-preprint].
The new methods can be found in the [smashr package][smashr].

If you find a bug, please post an [issue][issues].
