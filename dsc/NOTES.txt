notes
=====

+ How long is run_dsc expected to run for?

+ Are any special MATLAB toolboxes needed?

+ I'm using R 3.4.3 and MATLAB R2016b (9.1.0.441655).

+ I'm using these R packages:

   - AlgDesign 1.1-7.3
   - dscr 0.1-7
   - EbayesThresh 1.4-12
   - smashr 1.2-0
   - wavethresh 4.6.8

+ Matlab libraries:
  WaveLab (http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab),
  WavDen (http://www-ljk.imag.fr/SMS/software/GaussianWaveDen/down.html).

+ Note that there was a bug in blockJS.m; I've included the MALTAB
  code with the bug fix.m.
