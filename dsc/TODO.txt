to do 
=====

* Is graphs.Rmd needed? (I think it is!) If so, add packages used in
  graphs.Rmd to setup instructions.

* Add sessionInfo() to README.

* Fix system statements that use 'rm' command.

* Add more verbose to running methods, particularly methods that call
  MATLAB, so we know what is going on when things go wrong.

* Add WavDen info, including license info, to README.

* Add Wavelab info, including license info, to README. Also point to
  instructions for building/installing MEX files.
