to do
=====

* In README, fill out information about computing environment used to
  run/test code, including versions of R packages used. (This can be
  done with the help of sessionInfo.)

* Fill out instructions in README to reproduce results of paper.

* Rearrange scripts in analysis folder.

* Add WavDen info, including license info, to README.

* Add Wavelab info, including license info, to README. Also point to
  instructions for building/installing MEX files.

* Add sessionInfo() to README.

* Is graphs.Rmd needed? (I think it is!) If so, add packages used in
  graphs.Rmd to setup instructions.

* Add brief comments to top of run_dsc.R to explain what it does.
